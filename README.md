# Graduation-Project
## Image captioning has many advantages in almost every complex area of Artificial
## Intelligence. The main use case of our model is to help visually impaired to understand the
## environment and made them easy to act according to the environment. As, this is a complex
## task to do, with the help of pre trained models and powerful deep learning frameworks like
## Tensorflow and Keras, we made it possible.We evaluated model using global metric like BLEU
## This is completely a Deep Learning project, which makes use of multiple Neural Networks like
## Convolutional Neural Network and GRU to detect objects and captioning the images. To deploy
## our model as mobile application, we have used azure as a serve




### Using React Native
We can divide our applicationâ€™s main work into main 4 parts:
A- Learning android developing basics (took three weeks) with React native .
Before developing our application we needed to read about android because knowledge about
android developing was not sufficient enough to start developing the project.
B- Learn How to call API and pass it the Image
C- Learn how to take photo by camera or choose it from gallery
D- start build the screens of the application
