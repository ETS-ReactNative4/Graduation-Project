# Graduation-Project
### Using React Native
We can divide our applicationâ€™s main work into main 4 parts:
A- Learning android developing basics (took three weeks) with React native .
Before developing our application we needed to read about android because knowledge about
android developing was not sufficient enough to start developing the project.
B- Learn How to call API and pass it the Image
C- Learn how to take photo by camera or choose it from gallery
D- start build the screens of the application
